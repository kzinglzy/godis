/* * LRU approximation algorithm
 *
 * Redis uses an approximation of the LRU algorithm that runs in constant
 * memory. Every time there is a key to expire, we sample N keys (with
 * N very small, usually in around 5) to populate a pool of best keys to
 * evict of M keys (the pool size is defined by EVPOOL_SIZE).
 *
 * The N keys sampled are added in the pool of good keys to expire (the one
 * with an old access time) if they are better than one of the current keys
 * in the pool.
 *
 * After the pool is populated, the best key we have in the pool is expired.
 * However note that we don't remove keys from the pool when they are deleted
 * so the pool may contain keys that no longer exist.
 *
 * When we try to evict a key, and all the entries in the pool don't exist
 * we populate it again. This time we'll be sure that the pool has at least
 * one key that can be evicted, if there is at least one key that can be
 * evicted in the whole database. */
